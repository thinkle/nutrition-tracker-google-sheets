/*****************************
 * TODO: Implement /metrics/ and /goals/ endpoints
 *****************************/

/**
 * 1. /metrics/ Endpoint [DONE]
 *    - Purpose: Track physical metrics like weight, waist, and other measurements over time.
 *    - Features:
 *      - Logs individual metrics (POST).
 *      - Retrieves metrics for a date range or all time (GET).
 *    - Data Model:
 *      - Fields:
 *        - date: (string, YYYY-MM-DD)
 *        - weight: (number)
 *        - waist: (number)
 *        - otherMeasurements: (string, e.g., "hip: 40; chest: 38")
 *        - notes: (string, optional context for the measurement)
 *    - Implementation Steps:
 *      a. Add a `Metrics` sheet in the spreadsheet with columns: Date, Weight, Waist, OtherMeasurements, Notes.
 *      b. Implement POST to log a new metric or update an existing one.
 *      c. Implement GET to retrieve metrics, with support for filtering by `start_date` and `end_date`.

/**
 * 2. /goals/ Endpoint [DONE]
 *    - Purpose: Manage numeric and open-ended goals, aligned with the Logs tab structure.
 *    - Features:
 *      - Logs new goals or updates existing ones (POST).
 *      - Retrieves current goals or goal history (GET).
 *    - Data Model:
 *      - Fields:
 *        - Numeric Goals:
 *          - dailyKcalTarget, proteinTarget, carbTarget, fatTarget, fiberTarget, sugarTarget, alcoholTarget (all numeric).
 *        - Open-Ended Goals:
 *          - weightGoal: (string, e.g., "lose 10 pounds by June")
 *          - nutritionGoal: (string, e.g., "eat more vegetables")
 *          - otherGoal: (string, e.g., "improve energy levels")
 *        - date: (string, YYYY-MM-DD)
 *        - notes: (string, optional context for the goal)
 *    - Implementation Steps:
 *      a. Add a `Goals` sheet in the spreadsheet with columns:
 *         Date, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fats, Fiber, Sugar, Alcohol, WeightGoal, NutritionGoal, OtherGoal, Notes.
 *      b. Implement POST to log a new goal or update existing ones.
 *      c. Implement GET to retrieve the most recent goals or a full history.
 *      d. Use array formulas or script logic to dynamically calculate the current state by merging all goal updates.
 */

/**
 * 3. Shared Features and Enhancements:
 *    - Audit Trail:
 *      - Ensure all updates are logged sequentially without overwriting previous entries.
 *    - Dynamic Current State:
 *      - For `/goals/`, dynamically merge updates from the `Goals` sheet to calculate the most recent state.
 *      - For `/metrics/`, retrieve the latest logged values for each field when no date range is specified.
 *    - Flexibility:
 *      - Allow open-ended fields like `otherMeasurements` and `otherGoal` for nuanced tracking.
 *      - Avoid ENUMs in favor of free-text entries, ensuring compatibility with GPT's reasoning capabilities.
 */

/**
 * 4. Testing and Validation:
 *    - Test `/metrics/`:
 *      a. Log multiple entries for the same day with different notes to ensure proper handling.
 *      b. Retrieve metrics across a date range and confirm filtering works.
 *    - Test `/goals/`:
 *      a. Log numeric and open-ended goals in the same request and ensure they are stored correctly.
 *      b. Retrieve current goals by merging historical updates.
 *    - Validate Spreadsheet Updates:
 *      a. Use array formulas to summarize current states in a separate "Current" tab if needed.
 *      b. Ensure logs and goals are clear and traceable.
